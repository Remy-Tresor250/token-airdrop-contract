# Auto Airdrop Smart Contract for binance smart chain and Ethereum

I have been across many DAPPs to Airdrop Tokens. I found that DAPPs are charging way more to just privide airdrop services. This smart contract and airdrop.js code will help you to deploy your BSC/Ethereum Tokens without costing you extra money.

### Micro Documentation
we are using truffle framework for smart contract development and deployment. For auto airdrop we are using node.js script with web3.js for smart contract interation.
